20 - 10 - 25

It has been quite a journey since my last update. I have managed to reach new heights that I never 
knew were possible. My job has been an absolute blessing. Networking with my peers has been an
absolute gift. I am LOVING the job. Cannot have asked for a better cohort. I have encountered 
numerous challenges on the way but I have faced it head on and definitely gained a lot more than
I ever thought I would within two months. First of all, I think I gained higher levels of confidence.
If you asked me how to use tableau before my job I would have simply said "google it". Now I have
become far more proficient in it and as far as i can say "I kind of enjoy it" which is a very unpopular
opinion amongst my peers haha.

My in-person day was almost three weeks ago(wow that went quick) and I had to present to my peers.
I never knew that I would be able to present with such confidence. I still remember thinking to 
myself I know nothing about what I'm presenting but the truth be told... I did I just needed some 
faith. The presentation went amazingly. The team and I had performed brilliantly with everyone playing 
a crucial role in the success of it. Honestly, I would never have expected something to go as smooth 
as it did. Of course, there were the bumps on the road. But we overcame that through hard work, drive 
and resourceful thinking.

As I'm going on this journey I can see the gaps on where I need to improve and it feels good as I can
see myself taking action. I feel like a completely different person to where I was three weeks ago. So,
my advice for my younger self and any viewer looking at this text. Believe in yourself, give yourself 
space to grow, give yourself the acknowledgement that you aren't perfect. But the key skill is to allow
for a growth mindset and to overcome new obstacles is to brute force your way through it. Don't give up!
