Wow what a journey it has been! I accomplished things I just couldnt see myself getting out of. But i made it out on top!
This masters course has tested me in ways I never knew I could be tested. So whats new? I started up golf as a new hobby.
My dad, brother in law and extended family are golfers so I thought id give it a shot and I feel im improving. I'm going
for a 10K next month with a mate of mine. I did a 10 mile run last week - trying to lose the weight so I can finally start 
the gym. I start my job in September(thank god) and honestly Iam so eager to start it! 

One thing I learnt during this past year is everything comes in time. This may seem obvious, but techniques and routine
count towards something. I learnt that also switching up things when patterns just do not work. Don't be afraid to reach
out to ask for help. This years growth was my biggest yet, I feel that as time progresses your mindset changes and with
my work it has. Focus is everything but with focus you need skill to know what decisions to make. This is what I've learnt.
Learnings important but also ensuring the method you are using works is also very important.
