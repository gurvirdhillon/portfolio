May not be academically/career related but I wish to share some exciting news!
I have completed my first half marathon! A big milestone to me, I am an avid runner
and have a huge passion for running. Being able to overcome this obstacle has been huge.
As previously I have faced what i call "a wall" where I can do 10 miles maximum. Being able to
complete 13 miles has been a huge win for me and showed me that through dedication, hardwork
and commitment anything is truly possible.
