I am pleased to announce I am starting my Masters of Science course in Artificial Intelligence at Royal Holloway University of London.
I would like to thank everyone for the immense support as I embark on this incredible journey. This journey is not only about
expanding my knowledge and skill set but also allows me to gain a deeper understanding of myself and allows me to challenge myself.
