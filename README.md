# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This platform serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer. With new and wonderful designs, this website aims to provide the visitor with an overview of my work and expertise in the field of web development.

Through this portfolio I wish to demonstrate my knowledge from a range of web application to design prototypes and academic explorations. Each project has been accompanied by screenshots, links (if complete) to allow visitors to explore my work in depth.

Furthermore, this portfolio shares information such as my education, background and overall experiences. Visitors can learn about my skills and achivements through the different sections. As well as reviewing my CV for further details not provided.

Whether you are a potential employer, co worker or fellow developer, I invite you to explore my portfolio to discover more about my projects I have previously worked on. My details have been provided in the website under the phone icon/email icon.

Happy Web Surfing!
